        <h2>Nine10 Photo Gallery Plugin</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>What is it?</h3>
        <p>I built a simple plugin that took photos from the first native WordPress photo gallery on a page and placed them in a new layout that ordered them in a list form on the left hand side with a large viewer on the right hand side. </p>
        <h3>Skills Used/ Learned</h3>
        <p>This was my first big project with PHP and it went quite well. The php just identifies if their is a gallery and then takes to image urls and generates new html markup. Then I used some simple jQuery to handle the phots switching and highlighting.</p>
        <h3>What's Next</h3>
        <p>Now I am working on implementing something very similar on the Client Portal private galleries so clients can view their personal photos more easily.</p>

        <h2>Nine10 Photo Website Design Tweaks</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>Nine10 Photo hired me to modernize the layout of their site and ensure it was mobile froendly. I implemented a flat design with changes to the footer and article sections of every page. I also chaged to look of the client portal page and the contact and contact success pages. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303063110/http://nine10photo.com/">Go to Wayback Machine</a> to check out before pictures.</p>
        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>I met with the owner of Nine10 and offered some insight into the layout of modern webpages and the improvments we could make to the read ability and the overall look of the site.</p>
        <h3>Outcome</h3>
        <p>The result was a modern overhaul of the layout of the site. Pages no loger had a blocky border and elements span the length of the screen.</p>
